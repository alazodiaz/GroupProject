Types of variables in Java with respect to their scope:
    There are three types of variables in java with resect to their scope.
    Local instance and static.

    Local Variables:
        If a variable is declared inside a block of code like method, loop, if-condition,
        they are called local variables.

    Up-Side of a local variable:
        The upside is that they exist for a very short amount of time in the memory.
        Which means other programs on our computer can use that memory.

    Downside of Local Variables
        Their scope is ver limited, only exist inside that block in which they are created.
        We can't access them outside that block.

    When to use:
        We should always try to use local variables over instance variables whenever it is possible.

    Instance Variables:
        The variables which are declared inside a class but outside of block of code are called instance varibale.

    Upside:
        We can use these variables inside any block of code that is the inside that class.

    Downside:
        They occupy the memory for longer than a local variable.

    When we should use instance variables?
       1) When we need to share a value between two or more methods than we should go with the instance variables.
        2)When we are planning to create multiple objects of a class and it is possible that all the objects
          can have a different value for that variable.
        *should try our hardest not to use them*

   Static Variable:
        An instance variable with static keyword is called a static variable.

   Upside:
        We can share data across the object with the help of static variable.

   Downside:
        They occupy the memory for the longest period.
   When to use:
        When we want to share something across all methods.

=========================================================================
Access Modifiers:
    Access Modifiers are keywords which control the access of fields or methods or the class itself
    There are four access levels and three access modifier keyword. There are only applicable to
    instance or static variable not local variables

    1) Private:
        Private is the most restrictive one. If we use private keyword with any variable or method.
        We can only access it within the same class.
    When we should use private access modifier.
        we should always try to create variables as private.
        The data that we store inside the private variables is secured.

    2) Default Access Modifier
        Default is not a keyword. Whenever we don't assign any access modifier keyword like private or public
        Java accessing default access level to those variables or methods.
        The variables or methods which have default access level can be accessed within the same class or in any
        other class that is present inside the same package.
    3) Public Access Modifier
        Most unrestricted access modifer. Once used with a variable or method we can .........
        or method anywhere in our project.

    Note:
    We can only have
