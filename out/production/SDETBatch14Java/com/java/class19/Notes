this keyword
    "this" is a keyword like "class", "void". it is used in many places. For example if we have same name instance and a local variable we can use
    "this" to explicitly refer to instance variable. We can use "this()" to call a constructor inside another constructor.

   Why should we learn about "this" keyword:
    1) it allows us to have same name local varaibale and instance variables.
    2) if we have same code in two constructors we can reuse that code from one constructor inside another constuctor by
    writing "this()".

Inheritance:
    Inheritance is a mechanism is java through which we can use the fields/methods of one class inside another class.
    There are 4 types of inheritance.
    1) Single inheritance:
        In single inheritance we have only one parent and one child class.
        Employee--->person.
    2) Multilevel Inheritance:
        in multilevel inheritance we have inheritance in multiple levels like we have a grandfather-> father-> son ->grand son
    3) Hierarchical
        one parent class and multiple direct child classes.
Why should we learn inheritance?
    it allows to reduce the duplicate code.
What is the syntax?
    we can use this feature by writing extends keyword when declaring a class.
